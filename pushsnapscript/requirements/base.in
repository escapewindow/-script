# XXX Dependencies required by snapcraft._store.push
# snapcraft's setup.py doesn't include all dependencies define in
# its requirements.txt file.
# See https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/3.10/setup.py#L120
# and https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/3.10/requirements.txt.
#
# XXX Snapcraft does not always publish to Pypi and the last version there (3.8)
# is not Python3.8-compatible. That's why we have to install it from Github directly.
# Update setup.py if you bump snapcraft.
